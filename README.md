## Roberta Mangiapane

After over four years post education as 3D Artist, skilled in rigging, animation, television production and graphic design, I decided to get on the coding side to improve my tech skills.
I love challenges. I am self-motivated and hungry for success and I work as hard as possible to understand my responsibilities to hit the target, achieve high standards and make my mark.

## Skills

#### Logical Reasoning
I like to take a systematic approach to my work and I prefer developing logical processes for solving problems. I enjoy bringing order to chaos, applying rules to complete tasks in the most efficient way and I see myself as a logical thinker who works systematically.

#### Task and Time Management
With a great passion for research, I always ensure I seek better ways of doing things, being able to manage and organize several projects, prioritizing where necessary. I developed this skill with the help of brainstorming with the team, setting tasks and time available for them.

#### Emotional Intelligence and Self-Confidence
I have the ability to manage stressful situations, understanding other's points of view and emotions with good conflict management and problem-solving. I found out to have this ability when I faced the situation where the team and I had different ideas and we needed to find a compromise to getting the task done without compromising the quality of the work.
