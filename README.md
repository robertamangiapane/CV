## Roberta Mangiapane

I am a Junior Developer with experience background as 3D Artist, skilled in rigging, animation, television production and graphic design, competent in producing high quality work. I have over four years post education experience working with various organisation including advertising and TV. Besides my artistic skills, I decided to get on the coding side to improve my tech skills. I always have been keen on animation, videogames, and tech because in my opinion there is a limitless creative side in it as well, that can only grow.

## Skills

#### Task and Time Management
With a great passion for research, I always ensure I seek better ways of doing things, being able to manage and organize several projects, prioritizing where necessary. I developed this skill with the help of brainstorming with the team, setting tasks and time available for them.

#### Emotional Intelligence and Self-Confidence
I have the ability to manage stressful situations, understanding other's points of view and emotions with good conflict management and problem-solving. I found out to have this ability when I faced the situation where the team and I had different ideas and we needed to find a compromise to getting the task done without compromising the quality of the work.
